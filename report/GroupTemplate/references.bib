This system model is applicable to the complete human-computer system, including both computer systems in use and software products in use.
A product quality model composed of eight characteristics (which are further subdivided into subcharacteristics) that relate to static properties of software and dynamic properties of the computer system. The model is applicable to both computer systems and software products.},
