    abstract = {The increasing importance of automation and smart capabilities for factories and other industrial systems has led to the concept of Industry 4.0 (I4.0). This concept aims at creating systems that improve the vertical and horizontal integration of production through (i) comprehensive and intelligent automation of industrial processes, (ii) informed and decentralized real-time decision making, and (iii) stringent quality requirements that can be monitored at any time. The I4.0 infrastructure, supported in many cases by robots, sensors, and algorithms, demands highly skilled workers able to continuously monitor the quality of both the items to be produced and the underlying production processes. While the first attempts to develop smart factories and enhance the digital transformation of companies are under way, we need adequate methods to support the identification and specification of quality attributes that are relevant to I4.0 systems. Our main contribution is to provide a refined version of the ISO 25010 quality model specifically tailored to those qualities demanded by I4.0 needs. This model aims to provide actionable support for I4.0 software engineers that are concerned with quality issues. We developed our model based on an exhaustive analysis of similar proposals using the design science method as well as expertise from seasoned engineers in the domain. We further evaluate our model by applying it to two important I4.0 reference architectures further clarifying its application.}

    abstract = {In today's global competitive marketplace, there is intense pressure for manufacturing industries to continuously reduce and eliminate costly, unscheduled downtime and unexpected breakdowns. With the advent of Internet and tether-free technologies, companies necessitate dramatic changes in transforming traditional “fail and fix (FAF)” maintenance practices to a “predict and prevent (PAP)” e-maintenance methodology. E-maintenance addresses the fundamental needs of predictive intelligence tools to monitor the degradation rather than detecting the faults in a networked environment and, ultimately to optimize asset utilization in the facility. This paper introduces the emerging field of e-maintenance and its critical elements. Furthermore, performance assessment and prediction tools are introduced for continuous assessment and prediction of a particular product's performance, ultimately enable proactive maintenance to prevent machine from breakdowns. Recent advances on intelligent prognostic technologies and tools are discussed. Several case studies are introduced to validate these developed technologies and tools.}

    ABSTRACT = {The recent advancements in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have affected several research fields, leading to improvements that could not have been possible with conventional optimization techniques. Among the sectors where AI/ML enables a plethora of opportunities, industrial manufacturing can expect significant gains from the increased process automation. At the same time, the introduction of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), providing improved wireless connectivity for real-time manufacturing data collection and processing, has resulted in the culmination of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0. In this survey, we focus on the vital processes of fault detection, prediction and prevention in Industry 4.0 and present recent developments in ML-based solutions. We start by examining various proposed cloud/fog/edge architectures, highlighting their importance for acquiring manufacturing data in order to train the ML algorithms. In addition, as faults might also occur from sources beyond machine degradation, the potential of ML in safeguarding cyber-security is thoroughly discussed. Moreover, a major concern in the Industry 4.0 ecosystem is the role of human operators and workers. Towards this end, a detailed overview of ML-based human&ndash;machine interaction techniques is provided, allowing humans to be in-the-loop of the manufacturing processes in a symbiotic manner with minimal errors. Finally, open issues in these relevant fields are given, stimulating further research.},
