\begin{tabular}{|l|p{8cm}|} \hline
Name & Introduction of a new bike model \\ \hline
Actors & Assembly technician, production manager, production scheduler \\ \hline
Pre condition & A design of the new bike, specifying the required production  \\ \hline
Description & \begin{enumerate} 
\item The production manager logs into the the production software.
\item The production manager configures a new production step in the software.
\item The production manager asks the assembly technician to add new hardware to the assembly line.
\item The assembly technician installs hardware to the assembly line.
\item The production manager configures a new production run including the new production step in the software.
\item The production manager schedules a test run.
\item The production scheduler confirms the test schedule and starts the production run.
\item The assembly technician and production manager confirm the correctness of the newly established production run.
\end{enumerate} \\ \hline
Post condition & A new bike resembling a test artifact of the newly established production run. \\

\caption{Security use case}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{8cm}|} \hline
Name & Emergency shutdown due to malfunctioning test bench \\ \hline
Actors & Test bench, quality assurance worker \\ \hline
Pre condition & QA Worker performs quality assurance of the produced bike at a test bench. The test bench includes the use of robotic arms for easier inspection of the bike.  \\ \hline
Description & \begin{enumerate} 
 \item The quality assurance worker starts his inspection of the produced bike. Therefore, he uses a test bench that utilizes robotic arms enabling easier inspection of the bike (i.e. the robotic arms help to lift, rotate, etc. the bike).
\item While standing very close to the bike, the robotic arms begin to move the bike in unpredictable ways.
\item Sensors detect the proximity of the human worker to the malfunctioning machine.
\item The security system interprets it as threat to the human worker.
\item The security system shuts the malfunctioning test bench down and reports the shutdown to the supervisory system.
\end{enumerate} \\ \hline
Post condition & The production machine is shutdown and remaining work is load-balanced to the other machines that are available. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\caption{Availability use case}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{8cm}|} \hline
Name & Failure of one of the robotic arms. \\ \hline
Actors & Robotic arm, Supervisor system (system) and Production line worker \\ \hline
Pre condition & Production line is running  \\ \hline
Description & \begin{enumerate} 
\item One of the robotic arms suddently starts malfunctioning and not picking up parts.
\item The system notices that the arm that is malfunctioning is not assembling the parts it needs to assemble.
\item The system notifies the operator that the arm is malfunctioning.
\item The system checks if there is another robotic arm that can pickup for the failing robotic arm.
\item The system finds another robotic arm that can pickup the slack.
\item The system reconfigures the production to to use the other arm.
\item The system notifies the operator what it has changed.
\end{enumerate} \\ \hline
Post condition & The system keeps runnng with the other arm doing the job of the malfunctioning. \\
\hline

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{8cm}|} \hline
Name & Power outage interrupts the production line \\ \hline
Actors & Production line \\ \hline
Pre condition & The production line is running.  \\ \hline
Description & \begin{enumerate} 
\item The area for the production line encounters a loss of power for 5 minutes.
\item The power is back on again.
\item The production line is starting up again.
\item The production line queries the supervisor system for what the current task is and what the last state was.
\item The supervisor system responds with the details.
\item The product line uses the details from the supervisor system to resume activity
\end{enumerate} \\ \hline
Post condition & The product line is running again and continuing as normal. \\
