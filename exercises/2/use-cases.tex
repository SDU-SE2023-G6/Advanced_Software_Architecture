\begin{tabular}{|l|p{8cm}|} \hline
Name & Introduction of a new bike model \\ \hline
Actors & Assembly technician, production manager, production scheduler \\ \hline
Pre condition & A design of the new bike, specifying the required production  \\ \hline
Description & \begin{enumerate} 
\item The production manager logs into the the production software.
\item The production manager configures a new production step in the software.
\item The production manager asks the assembly technician to add new hardware to the assembly line.
\item The assembly technician installs hardware to the assembly line.
\item The production manager configures a new production run including the new production step in the software.
\item The production manager schedules a test run.
\item The production scheduler confirms the test schedule and starts the production run.
\item The assembly technician and production manager confirm the correctness of the newly established production run.
\end{enumerate} \\ \hline
Post condition & A new bike resembling a test artifact of the newly established production run. \\

\caption{Security use case}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{8cm}|} \hline
Name & Emergency shutdown due to malfunctioning test bench \\ \hline
Actors & Test bench, quality assurance worker \\ \hline
Pre condition & QA Worker performs quality assurance of the produced bike at a test bench. The test bench includes the use of robotic arms for easier inspection of the bike.  \\ \hline
Description & \begin{enumerate} 
 \item The quality assurance worker starts his inspection of the produced bike. Therefore, he uses a test bench that utilizes robotic arms enabling easier inspection of the bike (i.e. the robotic arms help to lift, rotate, etc. the bike).
\item While standing very close to the bike, the robotic arms begin to move the bike in unpredictable ways.
\item Sensors detect the proximity of the human worker to the malfunctioning machine.
\item The security system interprets it as threat to the human worker.
\item The security system shuts the malfunctioning test bench down and reports the shutdown to the supervisory system.
\end{enumerate} \\ \hline
Post condition & The production machine is shutdown and remaining work is load-balanced to the other machines that are available. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Availability use case}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{8cm}|} \hline
Name & Failure of one of the robotic arms. \\ \hline
Actors & Robotic arm, Monitoring system \\ \hline
Pre condition & Production line is running  \\ \hline
Description & \begin{enumerate} 
    \item The robotic arm is doing a rutine task it has been programmed for.
    \item The robotic arm suddenly encounters an error that causes it to malfunction.
    \item The robotic arm goes into safe mode and notifies the monitoring system.
    \item The Monitoring system notices that the robot is malfunctioning and creates a ticket for the a need of repair for the arm(Which system?).
    \item The Monitoring system tries to find another robot that can do the job of the arm.
    \item The Monitoring system finds another arm that can take the job of the malfunctioning arm.
    \item The other robotic arm picks up the load from the malfunctioning arm.
\end{enumerate} \\ \hline
Post condition & The system keeps runnng with the other arm is doing the job of the malfunctioning and there is a ticket about the malfunctioning robot in the system. \\
\hline

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{8cm}|} \hline
Name & Power outage interrupts the production line \\ \hline
Actors & Production line \\ \hline
Pre condition & The production line is running.  \\ \hline
Description & \begin{enumerate} 
\item The area for the production line encounters a loss of power for 5 minutes.
\item The power is back on again.
\item The production line is starting up again.
\item The production line queries the supervisor system for what the current task is and what the last state was.
\item The supervisor system responds with the details.
\item The product line uses the details from the supervisor system to resume activity
\end{enumerate} \\ \hline
Post condition & The product line is running again and continuing as normal. \\
